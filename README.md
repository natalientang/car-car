## Design

## Service microservice

I created a "Service" model that represents someone who wants to input a service which includes all of the properties and the identified foreign key. In this case, the foreign key of the service would be "technician" because it is its own model in which we want the information from as a dropdown. I created an "AutomobileVO" model to access the information of automobiles in the inventory service, most importantly the VIN to compare to the service VIN so that it could have the VIP status.

## Sales microservice
